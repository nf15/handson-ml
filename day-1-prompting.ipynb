    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

      "The modern understanding of fruits and vegetables' health benefits emerged gradually.  Early 20th-century nutritional science linked deficiencies to diseases like scurvy and rickets, highlighting the importance of vitamins and minerals found in produce.  Mid-century studies further emphasized their role in preventing chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.  Today, public health campaigns promote fruit and vegetable consumption, linking it to improved immunity, weight management, and overall well-being.  However, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to affordable, fresh produce, especially in underserved communities.\n",

He saw his chance. \n",

      "The adventure began with a symphony of scents.  The pungent aroma of freshly cut grass, the earthy musk of damp soil, and the heady perfume of honeysuckle – all a heady cocktail for a curious cat. He stalked through the long grass, a shadow of orange flitting between sunflowers, each blade a tiny, whispering secret.  \n",

      "His journey took him to a bustling market, a labyrinth of smells and sounds. He spied on a plump pigeon, preening its feathers, then darted between legs, a furry whirlwind of orange and white.  The vendors, surprised by his audacity, laughed, their laughter echoing through the vibrant, chaotic scene.  \n",

He found himself by the river, its surface mirroring the fading light. It was a place of peace, a sanctuary from the cacophony of the day. \n",

      "As darkness fell, Bartholomew knew it was time to return. He’d tasted freedom, felt the wind on his fur, and learned the secrets whispered by the world beyond the wall.  He slipped through the gate, his heart a purring drum of contentment. Back in the garden, he stretched, the familiar scent of lavender and rosemary a comforting embrace.  He was a changed cat, his eyes now holding a hint of the world he’d seen, a story etched in the amber of his gaze. \n",
